# Security Camera with Motion Detection

This project is aimed at creating a security camera that beeps on detection of a person or motion using Python and OpenCV.

## Introduction

Security cameras are an essential part of our lives, and they can be used for various purposes. One of the essential features of security cameras is motion detection, which can help in detecting any unusual activity. In this project, we will create a security camera that beeps on detection of a person or motion. We will use Python and OpenCV to build the security camera.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
Numpy
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash

pip install opencv-python numpy

## Dataset
No dataset is required for this project as we will be using the camera feed as the input.

## Running the Code
To run the code, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

bash

python security_camera.py
This will launch the security camera and start detecting motion. If any motion is detected, the security camera will beep.

## Results
The result of this project is a security camera that beeps on detection of a person or motion. This can be a useful tool for home security or any other security-related applications. With the help of OpenCV and Python, we can easily build a security camera that is both efficient and effective.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how to build a security camera that beeps on detection of a person or motion using Python and OpenCV. This project can be a good starting point for anyone interested in building a security camera or exploring motion detection using computer vision.
